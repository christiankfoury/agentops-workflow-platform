## Next Phase

### Phase 37: Root Cause Agent

Expected scope:

- Implement the Root Cause Agent.
- Consume completed incident timeline output.
- Identify confirmed causes, likely causes, unknowns, impact, and follow-up actions.
- Store root cause outputs as agent steps using the Phase 35 incident root cause schema.

Do not implement incident reviewer/writer, background jobs, auth, deployment work, or export/reporting features in Phase 37.

## Last Known Validation Pattern

Recent phases used:

```powershell
S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest <focused API test files>
S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\src S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\tests
pnpm --dir S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\web typecheck
pnpm --dir S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\web test:smoke
```

Note: a bare `python -m pytest` timed out once, while the same explicit API test files passed quickly.
