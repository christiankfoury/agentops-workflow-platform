## Next Phase

### Phase 39: Incident Evaluation Cases

Expected scope:

- Add 10 incident report evaluation cases.
- Expected outputs should include timeline events, impact, root cause, unsupported claim checks, and follow-up actions.

Do not implement background jobs, auth, deployment work, or export/reporting features in Phase 39.

## Last Known Validation Pattern

Recent phases used:

```powershell
S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest <focused API test files>
S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\src S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\tests
pnpm --dir S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\web typecheck
pnpm --dir S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\web test:smoke
```

Note: the full API test suite passed quickly in Phase 38.
