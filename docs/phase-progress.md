## Next Phase

### Phase 25: Evaluation Runner for Sales Reports

Expected scope:

- Build a script or backend endpoint that runs sales report evaluation cases.
- Support running both `baseline` and `multi_agent` modes against the same stored cases.
- Store each run result in `evaluation_results`.
- Keep evaluation scoring basic if needed; detailed metrics belong to Phase 26.

Do not implement the evaluation dashboard, customer feedback workflows, incident workflows, background jobs, auth, or deployment work in Phase 25.

## Last Known Validation Pattern

Recent phases used:

```powershell
S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest <focused API test files>
S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\src S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\tests
pnpm --dir S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\web typecheck
pnpm --dir S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\web test:smoke
```

Note: a bare `python -m pytest` timed out once, while the same explicit API test files passed quickly.
