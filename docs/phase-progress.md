## Next Phase

### Phase 22: Observability Timeline UI

Expected scope:

- Display workflow events visually on the workflow run detail page.
- Fetch the new workflow events endpoint for a run.
- Show event timestamp, event type, message, optional agent context, metadata summary, and error message.
- Keep the UI focused on observability timeline display only.

Do not implement baseline workflows, evaluation dashboards, customer feedback, incident workflows, background jobs, auth, or deployment work in Phase 22.

## Last Known Validation Pattern

Recent phases used:

```powershell
S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest <focused API test files>
S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\src S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\tests
pnpm --dir S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\web typecheck
pnpm --dir S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\web test:smoke
```

Note: a bare `python -m pytest` timed out once, while the same explicit API test files passed quickly.
