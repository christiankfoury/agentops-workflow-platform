## Next Phase

### Phase 50: Evaluation Report Export

Expected scope:

- Add the ability to export evaluation results.
- Support CSV export, JSON export, and Markdown report export.

Do not implement file uploads, background jobs, auth, or deployment work in Phase 50.

## Last Known Validation Pattern

Recent phases used:

```powershell
S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest <focused API test files>
S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\src S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\api\tests
pnpm --dir S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\web typecheck
pnpm --dir S:\github-repos\agentops-workflow-platform\apps\web test:smoke
```

Note: the full API test suite passed quickly in Phase 42.
